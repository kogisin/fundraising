# Concepts

## Fundraising Module

The `x/fundraising` Cosmos SDK module provides an oppotunity for new projects to onboard the ecosystem. It does not only allow projects to raise funds, but also increase their brand awareness before launching their projects.

## Auction Types

There are two different types of auctions in the fundraising module.
### English Auction

An english auction type is an ascending dynamic auction that an auctioneer decides the starting price of the selling amount of coin and bidders bid to purchase the amounts of the coin. Competition for the price, not how fast bidders can bid.
### Fixed Price Auction

A fixed price auction type is a fixed price auction that autioneer decides the fixed price for each selling amounts of coin and bidders bid to purchase based on the fixed price. A characteristic of the auction type is first come first served.
